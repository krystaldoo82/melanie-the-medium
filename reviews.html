      <blockquote class="testimonial">"Hi Melanie, this is Debbie Khan. I wanted to tell you the reading we had was very spot on but most importantly it helped save my daughters life. The one with the weight loss surgery you mentioned she was having stomach issues. I couldn't shake that I needed to have her checked out again. 
<br>
The next morning Elizabeth's doctor (who we work for) came in early walked right in my office and said Debbie I couldn't sleep half the night I was so worried about Elizabeth. We need to get her into the hospital and get the gastric doctor to see her today. I thought of what you said and I agreed. We had the dr paged and got her admitted. She had a scope today she ha the largest ulcer he's ever seen with a massive blood clot on it. He said it's so bad that if she ate a bag of potato chips it would rupture. She needed three units of blood."

      <blockquote class="testimonial">"Words cannot describe how thankful I am to Melanie. Skeptical, I scheduled an appointment with her and 60 seconds into my first appointment she blew me away. My life was upside down and in an hour she was able to bring closure and peace. I left our meeting feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the world.
      <br>
Melanie gave me the tools and the confidence that I needed to do so. She has been there for me since my first reading. Three months since my first reading and my life has changed drastically. My family is closer than ever, my children are blooming and my marriage has been saved. I scheduled a second reading with her and brought my 'macho- ever doubting' husband along for the visit. Ladies and Gentlemen he left there a believer and a bit teary eyed. He wa completely moved by the whole experience. Whatever is holding you back, let it go and make your first appointment... I promise you will be glad you did."

She started telling me about different family members that had passed on. She told me I was surrounded by angels. Whenever I mentioned a passed loved one, they would step forward and Melanie would describe them and give me their message. I felt surrounded by love and cried tears of joy. I highly recommend Melanie's Mediumship services"

I went to your house for  a group question and answer type meeting for you to explain what a medium was. I really had no expectations due to the fact that I did not know what I was going to. I mean I knew what a medium was I just didn't know what to expect. We were late lol and you met us at the door. I sat down and you started telling me that a man was very adamant about me being there. What you didn't know was it was the 10th anniversary of my father being hit on a motorcycle and I had to pass the scene to get to your house. You started explaining it was either my father or my grandfather and with one single word I knew exactly who it was. That word was a word that would only mean something to me and it was only connected to one person. My father. Bone fires  were something that was a big thing to both of us. It was something that always brought up great memories. It was our bonding time. I instantly started to cry but I also froze. At that point you pretty much explained his passing. You would explain feelings that would sum up everything that went on. I remember thinking how was this possible. I was so stunned I couldn't think all I could do was cry. Then with two more simple words you made me bust out laughing. Pancakes and peanut butter. (Which I still think is gross by the way) But he loved it. You did help me find peace that night. But you also helped me understand where my anxiety came from. As horrible as my dads passing was there was another person that came up and his name was joe. He was the first person I ever remember passing away that wasn't an aunt or uncle that was just old. He was the first tragedy I remember. I'm thirty six years old and some thing that happened when I was in ninth grade came up. What are the chances of that? All in all I would say you helped me have a better understanding of my self. You helped me discover where my fear truly came from, you helped me to gain a little peace in my fathers passing, and you helped me learn that it was ok that I was a little screwed up from these things. But the most amazing part is I only said about five words. There was no story line given for you to peice a puzzle together. There was my story told by you not me and I think that was the most amazing part. You are truly blessed and you know that but I don't think you truly know how much you bless others. I don't know if I did ever tell you thank you but just in case I didn't. THANK YOU"

      <blockquote class="testimonial">"(  First reading )   I went for my first reading for Melanie to do , with my husband.  His mom and dad have passed . I prayed to God that if Melanie was real that God give Heath some kind of peace in his heart.  His dad dies in his arms when he was 20 yrs old and his mom passed . He was not able to tell her goodbye.  He was skeptical about how true Melanie's  vision's are or her  as a person if she was even for real . So ... As Melanie knew nothing about us . She caught on to my husband right away . She told him , "You are not sure about me " . He answered her honestly and said " not really ", and laughed it off. He was just there for me . Well.... It turned out that Heath's family was more active in that reading then mine. My grandmother let herself be known real quick . She has always been the sassy red head you knew when she entered the room alive or in spirit. Then , Heath's brother " Dennis " a spirit with a high energy level was there wanting to talk to Heath. Melanie described Health's brother , and dad. Told me about my other grandmother who passed when I was a little girl. How she plays with my daughters hair , and loves my kids that she has only been around in spirit. Melanie described things about my grandmother favorite color , how I use to make necklaces. all this things this women could of never know about me . We both left Melanie's house with peace & love in our hearts . She is real , she is blessed by God for good not for evil ....

( Second reading ) I call this one " Lost in the dark "  I am an addict and alcoholic this year I would of had six years clean and sober . I stopped going to meetings , I got busy with life, and I forgot where I came from . I had a couple of drinks . My mind said " you can drink , it's ok you will not go crazy like you use to " I told my husband and my family . They were all scared because my past is not a good one . I have been in the dark and then went into a hole . I was beyond human aid. Only God could get me out . I stayed sober for all most six years . Thinking I can drink and go back into that hole. My mind played tricks on me. I prayed to God to help me see if I am wrong or if I really can drink. That's when I started seeing my family that had passed in my dreams . I couldn't remember what they would say I just will wake up and know they were there. I was so confused . I called Melanie, " I need a reading"! I get there she says,  " what kind of reading are you wanting because I see this situation is terminal " The disease of addiction is terminal !! I tell her just a little . And ... She then opened my eyes and mind to the blindness I was in . This reading saved my life I believe that in my heart. She gave me advice and told me how all my angels are here trying to protect me from the evil that has attached to me. See.... The closer we get to God , to more the evil waits for s to become weak . In July I became weak in my spiritual relationship with God because I turned my back on him . As I was awakened to this moment of clarity I see where I feel short and I now see where I have to be selfless and help others . Standing firm on my foundation of my God of understanding. I have a lot of work to do . But... I'm not alone my angels are here and so is God.  Thank you Melanie I am now a recycled angel and I chose to live !"
